# Vicinity Mobile App

This project is for a social app designed for Johns Hopkins Univeristy students to make peer-to-peer recommendations about events and activities to do around local areas of Baltimore, MD. Some of the main functions that users can perform are:
- Post recommendations with tags detailing the type of activity, the cost, the required distance from Homewood Campus, and more
- Ask questions for other students to answer
- Post anonyously to maintain privacy
